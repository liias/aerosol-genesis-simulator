    <h1>Aerosol Burst Simulator</h1>

    <h2>User Manual</h2>

    <p>This program has two main purposes: to simulate atmospheric aerosol
    nucleation bursts and analyze simulation results - compare with the results
    measured in real life.</p>

    <h1><a id="Modeling" name="Modeling"></a>Modeling<a class="section_anchor"
    href="#Modeling"></a></h1>

    <p><strong>Simulation with fixed parameters</strong></p>

    <p>To execute a simulation with fixed parameters, user have to set
    inception parameters to all "Minimum" fields and press "Run" button. User
    can use program default values (already set when program is launched) or
    use own values.</p>

    <p>When simulation is ongoing, "Run" button goes inactive and "Stop" button
    becomes active. When simulation is done, again "Run" button is active and
    "Stop" is inactive.</p>

    <p>Note: In order to browse simulation results, a separate database
    browsing program, such as "SQLite Database Browser" can be used. Program
    database file "ags.db " is located in
    ..\aerosol-simulator-1.0-SNAPSHOT\etc\database\ folder.</p>

    <p><strong>Simulation with generated parameters</strong></p>

    <p>To execute a simulation with generated parameters, user have to set
    inception parameters to all "Minimum" and "Maximum" fields and press "Run"
    button. A random value between given range will be generated automatically.
    User can use values suggested from drop-down menus or use own values.</p>

    <p>When simulation is ongoing, "Run" button goes inactive and "Stop" button
    becomes active. When simulation is done, again "Run" button is active and
    "Stop" is inactive.</p>

    <p><strong>Simulation with combined parameters</strong></p>

    <p>This is a combination from two previous options - some inception
    parameters are fixed and some shall be generated. To execute a simulation
    with combined values, user have to set inception parameters to all
    "Minimum" fields and to those "Maximum" fields, where parameters are not
    fixed and press "Run" button. User can use values suggested from drop-down
    menus or use own values.</p>

    <p>When simulation is ongoing, "Run" button goes inactive and "Stop" button
    becomes active. When simulation is done, again "Run" button is active and
    "Stop" is inactive.</p>

    <p><strong>Simulation with parameters from file</strong></p>

    <p>To execute a simulation with values from file, user have to press a
    "Take values from file" button, select the file.</p>

    <p>When simulation is ongoing, "Run" button goes inactive and "Stop" button
    becomes active. When simulation is done, again "Run" button is active and
    "Stop" is inactive.</p>

    <p>Note: A whole inception parameters set is described in one row. So there
    are as many parameters sets to run as there are rows in the file. Every
    parameter is described with two values - minimum and maximum value, written
    between "" and parameters itself are separated with ;. Sample:
    45";"50";"37";"";"1";"";.....;[line ends] means "Time period under
    consideration" minimum is 45 and maximum value is 50, "Number of evolution
    steps in a minute" has only minimum value defined - so this value will be
    fixed to 37, Air temperature has fixed value of 1 and so on.</p>

    <p>For excel to export a proper CSV file for our program the List separator
    must be set as ; in your settings. To change that: Go to the Control Panel
    --&gt; Regional and Language Options (or Date, Time and Regional Options
    --&gt; Regional and Language Option on some machines) --&gt; click the
    Customize button. In the dialog box that opens you will see and option for
    "List separator" in which you can change the comma to a different character
    --&gt; click Apply then Ok and then Apply again. After you have saved the
    file with parameters you open it with excel. A dialog will appear, you must
    press yes there and click next. In the next window, in the upper left
    corner, choose semicolon as the delimiter and click next. In the last
    window activate the first column in the preview at the bottom and
    shift+click on the last column to activate all of them and choose text as
    the column data format in the upper left corner and click finish. Now it
    should have imported into excel and each of the data points is in a separate
    column.</p>

    <p>Reference values are in
    ..\aerosol-simulator-1.0-SNAPSHOT\etc\conf\ref.xl file. First line is
    columns explanation, second is column "weights" and third and further lines
    are actual values. User can freely modify those values, including column
    "weights".</p>

    <p><strong>Finding closest inception parameters sets</strong></p>

    <p>In order to compare reference values with simulated values and determine
    which inception parameters gave closest results to a reference values,
    simply press the "Find Best Results" button. When program is done, a dialog
    window will pop-up with an option to save (up to ten closest) results into
    a file.</p>

    <p>File with reference values are located in
    ..\aerosol-simulator-1.0-SNAPSHOT\etc\conf" folder, ref.xl file. Second line
    is column "weights".</p>

    <p><strong>Set best parameters</strong></p>

    <p>To get best inception parameters set into a program "Minimum" fields,
    simply click on "Open Best" button.</p>

    <p>You can export all your local program data into a file and import to
    other computer with same program or make searches in local database
    without having any database browser program, such as "SQLite Database
    Browser" installed into your computer.</p>

    <p><strong>Import</strong></p>

    <p>To import all data, simply click on "Utilities" button and a separate
    window will pop-up. Click on "Import" and a dialog window will pop, select
    a file with data and you are done.</p>

    <p><strong>Export</strong></p>

    <p>To export all data, simply click on "Utilities" button and a separate
    window will pop-up. Click on "Export" and a dialog window will pop, give
    file a name and location and you are done.</p>

    <p><strong>Export specific result set by id</strong></p>

    <p>To export specific result set, simply click on "Utilities" button and
    write an id number (e.g .pid number from a file created by "Find Best
    Results" function) and then click on "Save Results". Now result set of that
    specific inception parameters will be written into a file of user
    choice.</p>

    <p><strong>Open specific parameters</strong></p>

    <p>Select "Process" from a drop-down menu, write a pid (id) number and
    click on "Open order or process by id". Inception parameters of that
    specific run will be loaded.</p>

    <p>If you also know the id of the simulations group (order) you can select
    "Order" from drop-down menu, put that id into a text field and press the
    button again. Simulations group (order) simply has the maximum fields set.
    If you start simulating based on these min and max values the application
    will generate totally different simulation parameters as it did in the
    past, because it generates randomly between min and max values.</p>
