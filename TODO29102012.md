Unit Tests

Saving and opening form field values to CSV

//A different order out of processes which might contain very different parameter values (not between min max) OR separate order for each such process. Vanas programmis oli selle jaoks Take values from file ja number of runs ei omanud m√µju sel juhul

Finding the best n results (write them to a tab-separated file or similar, first columns: rating, pid, comment)

Configuration file outside of jar (under conf, where ref.xl is atm)

Overall testing & bugfixes
